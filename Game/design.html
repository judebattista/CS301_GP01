              Our game features a dinosaur in a wilderness setting. Thanks to the Lockian nature of the universe, the dinosaur and the human inhabitants establish
              an atmosphere of mutual respect as the underpinnings of burgeoning trust and friendship. The player's goal as the dinosaur is to strengthen this incipient bond 
              leading to the collective success of the dinosaur/city symbiosis. Note: this feature is not yet implemented. In this prototype, the dinosaur just stomps 
              around and breaks <span class="strikethrough">sh</span> stuff. Hobbes was right!
          </p>
          <p><span class="blackUnderline bold">Planned features</span>:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Wilderness as backdrop.</li>
              <li>The dinosaur attempts to destroy vehicles, people, and aircraft for points.</li>
              <li>The dinosaur has three attacks available: bite, stomp, and tail whip.</li>
              <li>The dinosaur can destroy some environmental objects with its attacks.</li>
              <li>Destroying some objects creates health pickups, allowing the dinosaur to survive longer and create more mayhem.</li>
              <li><span class="blackUnderline bold">Potential Threats</span>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Meteors</li> 
                      <li>Other dinosaurs</li>
                      <li>Missiles and Aircraft - aerial threats</li>
                      <li>Environmental hazards - <span class="explosions">EXPLOSIONS?!</span></li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li> <span class="blackUnderline bold">Background</span>
                  <ul>

                      <li>Back layer: sky and clouds</li>
                      <li>Mid layer: mountains</li>
                      <li>Front layer: path and interactive objects</li>
